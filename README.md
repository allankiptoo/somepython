Grade Processing Application

Overview

This Python application reads student grades from a CSV file and extracts maximum points from a JSON configuration file. The application cleans the grades, calculates total and percentage scores, and assigns a letter grade based on performance.

Requirements

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

Python 3.x

Pandas library

JSON module (built-in in Python)

Files Used

tasks.json - Contains the grading structure, including maximum points per assignment type.

grades_50.csv - Stores student grades for different assignments.

Installation and Setup

1. Install Required Libraries

Make sure you have pandas installed. If not, run:

pip install pandas

2. File Path Configuration

Modify the file paths in the script to match your system:

file_path = r"C:/Users/hp/Desktop/pool on this side/2025/nancy/tasks.json"
grades_file = r"C:/Users/hp/Desktop/pool on this side/2025/nancy/grades_50.csv"

How to Run the Application

Open a terminal or command prompt.

Navigate to the script's directory.

Run the script using:

python script_name.py

Functionality

Reads maximum grading points from tasks.json.

Loads grades from grades_50.csv.

Cleans grades to ensure they are within valid ranges.

Calculates total earned points and maximum possible points.

Computes the percentage score.

Assigns a letter grade based on the percentage.

Displays the final grade output in the terminal.

Example Output

You have 850 out of 1000
Your percentage is 85.00
Your letter grade is: B

Troubleshooting

If you encounter file path errors, ensure that the paths to tasks.json and grades_50.csv are correctly specified.

If pandas is missing, install it using pip install pandas.

If unexpected results appear, check the input data in the CSV file for errors.

Future Improvements

Add exception handling for missing or corrupted files.

Implement a GUI for user-friendly interaction.

Allow dynamic file path input from the user.
